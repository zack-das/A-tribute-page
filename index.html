  <h2>Who He Was</h2>
  <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was more than a brilliant scientist and former President of India—he was a teacher at heart, a visionary who believed in the power of young minds to shape the future. He came from humble beginnings in Rameswaram, and through sheer determination, became a guiding light for millions.</p>

  <h2>Why He Inspires Me</h2>
  <p>What makes him special isn't just his achievements in aerospace or his role in India's defense—it's the way he never stopped learning, teaching, and dreaming. He stayed grounded and humble, always encouraging us to believe that no dream is too big.</p>

  <h2>Legacy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed India's first satellite launch vehicle</li>
    <li>Served as the 11th President of India (2002–2007)</li>
    <li>Authored books like <strong>Wings of Fire</strong>, <strong>Ignited Minds</strong>, and <strong>India 2020</strong></li>
    <li>Awarded India's highest civilian honor, the <strong>Bharat Ratna</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top: 40px;">Even though he's no longer with us, his words, his passion, and his commitment to education continue to echo across generations. Thank you, Dr. Kalam, for showing us how to dream—and how to make those dreams real.</p>
